Tiled 1.5 brings a large amount of improvements, including a more powerful
Terrain Brush, parallax scrolling and GameMaker Studio 2.3 export!

### Unified Wang and Terrain tools

Since the addition of Wang tiles in [Tiled 1.1][Tiled-1-1] there were two very
similar tools, each with their own set of features and limitations. Now, these
tools have been unified into [one powerful tool][terrain] for automatic corner
and edge-based tile placement. The new "Terrain Brush" even supports the [blob
tileset][blob], a much requested feature that was previously not supported by
either tool.

#### Painting with an edge-based tileset

</div>

#### Painting with a blob tileset

</div>

The unified tool also supports [flipping or rotating tiles][transformations],
either to create versions that otherwise don't exist in a tileset or for more
variation.

***Compatibility Note:** The [storage format][docs-wangset] has changed such
that older Tiled versions will not be able to read terrain information saved
by Tiled 1.5.*

### Parallax Scrolling Factor

While custom parallax scrolling factors could previously be set using custom
properties, this way it is not possible to see a level like it would appear in
the game while editing, which can be important for prop placement. Now Tiled
features a built-in property for controlling the [parallax scrolling
factor][docs-parallax] per layer, along with an optional live preview.

*The level shown above is from the game [Super Catboy][Super Catboy], still in
development.*

### New Export Formats

<img src="/img/posts/2021-03-gamemaker-studio.png" style="width: 192px; margin: 0; float: right;">

Tiled can now [export maps to GameMaker Studio 2.3][GameMaker Export], which
uses an entirely different file format than the still supported GameMaker:
Studio 1.4. The export even covers tiles placed on isometric and hexagonal
grids, which are normally not supported by GameMaker. It does this by
exporting the tile layer to an Asset layer.

Another tool you can now export maps to is RPTools [MapTool][MapTool], though
for now only tile layers using image collection tilesets are supported. It
does support tile flipping and rotation, which is needed when using "ProBono's
6x6 Mega Tile Pack V2 - Grid50" included with MapTool. A terrain set
definition for this tileset is available at
[cpetig/tilesets][cpetig/tilesets].

### Customization Options

It is now possible to make the "Select Object" tool prefer picking objects
from the selected layer, or to only pick objects from selected layers. This
can really help when dealing with overlapping objects or when group-selecting
multiple objects where the region includes objects from other layers that you
don't want to select. When "Highlight Current Layer" is enabled, objects from
the selected layers are automatically preferred.

The panning behavior can now be customized. For the middle mouse button
there's an option to use auto-scrolling (used in the video demonstrating
parallax above). When using the arrow keys, the view will now scroll smoothly
by default, instead of in steps based on key repetition.

### Scripting

A few major additions have been made to the scripting API, which can now
[load, save and modify images][script-image] and [launch external
processes][script-process]. Scripted actions can now also be added to most
context menus and they get a default icon to make them stand out from the
built-in actions.
