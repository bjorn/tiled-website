This release makes a number of small improvements over [Tiled 1.5][Tiled-1-5] and fixes some regressions. It also adds crash reporting (for the Linux AppImage), object selection preview and other new features.

### Crash Reporting

To be able to understand the general stability of Tiled and to immediately get useful information (the call stack, mostly) as soon as a crash happens, I've now integrated [Sentry][sentry] as crash handler. You can read more about what information is sent out exactly on the [crash reporting](/crash-reporting) page.

Unfortunately this feature is currently only available for the Linux AppImage. In future releases I hope to make it available for Windows and macOS releases as well. Please consider enabling this feature to help me make Tiled more stable!

### Object Selection Improvements

While dragging the selection rectangle to select objects, the objects that would be selected are now highlighted (similarly to the hovered object). This helps avoid that short moment of disappointment, when you realize the objects that got selected were not what you had intended.

At the same time, you can now toggle between selecting "touched" objects (the old behavior) and "enclosed" objects. The latter mode really helps if your goal is to select a bunch of smaller objects that overlap a large one. It can be toggled either persistently on the tool bar or temporarily with the Alt modifier.

Many more small improvements and fixes were made, so see the changelog below for the full list.
